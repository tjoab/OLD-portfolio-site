But if it's false, then the statement is true. So if it's not true and not false, what is it? We have an unresolvable paradox. This question seems like a pointless thought experiment but in the 20th century, this question was at the core of a heated debate amongst mathematicians, subsequently changing mathematics forever.</p>\n<h2>The Beginnings of Set Theory</h2>\n<p>This story actually starts a bit before then, in 1870. A German mathematician by the name of <u><strong>Georg Cantor</strong></u> has just published a paper that outlined a new branch of mathematics called <u><strong>set theory</strong></u>. A set is actually quite simple, it is just a well defined collection of <em>things</em>. The two shoes on your feet, a set. The collection of all planets, a set. All the even numbers, a set. A set can contain every<em>thing</em>, but could also contain no<em>thing</em>. In Cantor's case, he was concerned with sets that contained numbers, like the natural numbers or the <em>reals</em>. The natural numbers refer to the set of all positive integers, i.e. {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...}, whereas the real numbers refer to <strong>any</strong> number that can be expressed as a decimal; so things like fractions, π, or the square root of 2. Cantor thought to himself one day; \"are there more natural numbers... or real numbers between 0 and 1?\"</p>\n<h2>The Diagonalization Proof</h2>\n<p>Well to me and you, the answer seems obvious; both sets have an infinite amount of elements. And while that's true, Cantor did us one better. He approached the question in a simple manner. If he could list all of the natural numbers, and next to each one write a real number, then he would know that the two sets are of the same size. Suppose we've created such an infinite list. We're going to use each pair to construct a new real number that lays between 0 and 1. From the first pair, lets take the first digit to be the first digit of our new number. From the second pair, lets take the second digit to be the second digit of our new number, and so on. You may have noticed it; there's a glaring asterisk with this methodology. Our newly constructed number can't be on our list.</p>\n<div style = \"display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center\">\n    <img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/dKBtPfH/Untitled-Artwork-27.png\" alt=\"The Diagonalization Proof\" height=550rem>\n</div>\n<p>By the procedure in which it was constructed, our number is different from the first number in the first decimal place, different from the second number in the second decimal place and so on down the list. It has to be different from every number on the list by at least one digit; the number on the diagonal. This was Cantor's <u><strong>diagonalization proof</strong></u>, not only was it quite clever, but it also shook up the world of mathematics, for Cantor has just shown that there are more real number between 0 and 1 than there are natural numbers extending out to infinty. Not all infinities are the same size. Cantor categroized these concepts as being <em>countably</em> infinite, or <em>uncountably</em> infinite.</p>\n<p>For a couple thousand years, Euclid's elements were considered the bedrock of the dicipline, but at the turn of the nineteenth century, Lobachevsky and Gaus discovered non-euclidean geometries prompting mathematicians to more closely examine the foundations of their field. The idea of a limit, at the heart of calculus, turned out to be poorly defined, and now Canter was showing that infinity itself was much more complex than anyone had imagined. In all this upheaval, mathematics fractured and a huge debate broke out among mathematicians. On one side were the <u><strong>intuitionists</strong></u>—convinced that math was a pure creation of the human mind and so infinities like Canter's weren't real—while on the other side were the <u><strong>formalists</strong></u>—believing that math could be put on an absolutely secure logical foundation through Cantor's set theory.</p>\n<h2>The Self-Referencing Paradox</h2>\n<p>One of the most famous formalists was highly influential German mathematician <u><strong>David Hilbert</strong></u>, truly, a living legend. Hilbert knew that Cantor's work was genius and was convinced that a more formal system of math based on Cantor's set theory could solve all of the issues that had cropped on in math over the last century. Most mathematicians agreed, but in 1901, logician <u><strong>Bertrand Russell</strong></u> pointed out something we have already discussed. Russell knew that if sets can contain anything, then obviously they could contain themselves. He pointed out a paradox that arises when we consider the set of all sets that <strong>don't</strong> contain themselves. If this set doesn't contain itself... well then it <strong>must</strong> contain itself. But if this set <strong>does</strong> contain itself, then it <strong>must not</strong> contain itself. Sound familar? This is the same pardox of self-reference we considered when examining \"this statement is false\".</p>\n<p>The formalists remedied the issue by redefining some things but self-reference refused to die quite that easily.</p>\n<h2>Hilbert's Questions</h2>\n<p>Hilbert went on to continue his quest of developing a new system for mathematical proofs. At the core, his idea was nothing new, in fact, it dates back to the ancient Greeks. The system relied on <u><strong>axioms</strong></u>—simple undeniable rules or buidling blocks to be rearranged, put together and ultimately build incredible structure. This building and rearrangement process follows the rules of inference and is called a <u><strong>theorem</strong></u>. The blueprints detailing how the structure was build is the <u><strong>proof</strong></u>. With this <em>axiomatic</em> system, mathematical claims can be proved or disproved with total certainty.</p>\n<p>Hilbert desired a formal system just like this, but built with <em>symbols</em>. He wanted to express the axioms of mathematics as symbolic statements and set up rules for symbol manipulation. In 1913, the <em>Principia Mathematica</em> was published, providing the world with a formal system of symbolic logical. Unlike ordinary language, symbols left no room for errors or fuzzy logic to creep in, and most importantly, <strong>it allowed you to prove properties of the formal system itself</strong>. Hilbert had three big questions. <u><strong>Is math complete</strong></u>—meaning every true statement can be proven true. <u><strong>Is math consistent</strong></u>—meaning the system is free from contradictions. And <u><strong>is math decidable</strong></u>—meaning is there a way to always determine whether a statement follows from the axioms, i.e. is true. Hilbert was convinced that the answer to all three of these questions was yes.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Completeness</li>\n<li>Consistency</li>\n<li>Decidable</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I think that intuitively, the first and third questions are straightforward. The second question, a bit more... <em>abstract</em>. I think that consistency is best understood by an example. Suppose our system <strong>is not</strong> consistent, i.e. condradictions exist. Then we can prove that \"the sky is blue\" and that \"the sky is not blue\" are both true. Now consider a third arbitrary statement, \"dragons exist\". In this inconsistent system, we can prove that \"dragons exist\". Using the <strong>OR</strong> operator, (\"the sky is blue\" OR \"dragons exist\") is true since we have already proved that \"the sky is blue\" is true. But the \"the sky is blue\" is also false since we know that \"the sky is not blue\" is true. So in our OR statement, the first part is false... but the whole statement is true since we already proved that earlier. Then it <strong>must</strong> be the case that \"dragons exist\" is true.</p>\n<p>With an inconsistent system, <em>anything</em> can be proved true; so it's useless to us.</p>\n<h2>The Incompleteness Theorem &#x26; The Halting Problem</h2>\n<p>At a major conference in 1938, Hilbert gave a passionate speech about these questions and concluded his talk with the famous words, \"we must know, we will know\". But even as Hilbert was giving this speech, his dream was already crumbling.\nDays prior to this meeting, 24-year-old logician <u><strong>Kurt Gödel</strong></u> had discovered the answer to Hilbert's first question. He had proven that a complete formal system of mathematics could not exist; mathematics has intrinsic limitations. Despite the huge discovery, no one paid much attention to Gödel. That is, not until he published his proof to <u><strong>the Incompleteness Therorem</strong></u>. This time, everyone including Hilbert noticed.</p>\n<p>The premise behind Gödel's proof was to encode mathematical statements with numbers, so-called Gödel numbers. You can imagine there to be quite a few Gödel numbers, so in some instances Gödel used letters to represent really large Gödel numbers. After some time playing around with mathematical statements, Gödel found a statement that said \"there is no proof for the statement with Gödel number g\". This seems reasonable, but the caveat was that this statement was encoded by Gödel number g. <strong>Self-reference makes its grand re-appearence</strong>. If the statement is false, then there exists a proof. But if there exists a proof, we get a contradiction with the statement. So then the statement must be true. There is no contradiction... but then there exists no proof. We just showed that this system contains true statements with no proof; the system is not complete. Hilbert was wrong.</p>\n<p>Despite this blow, Hilbert can likely console himself knowing that his other two questions could still be true... right? Well not quite, as Gödel strikes again with his second proof. This time, he's shown that a consistent system cannot prove its own consistency. So the best system we could hope for is one that is consistent—since an inconsistent system is useless—and incomplete—since a complete system does not exist. But even with such a system, its own consistency cannot be proven; so at any point in time, a contradiction <em>could</em> arise revealing that the system you've been using was inconsistent all along. How lovely.</p>\n<p>With Hilbert weeping, at least he could rest easy knowing that mathematics is decidable. But that would be a lie. In 1936, <u><strong>Alan Turing</strong></u> was able to answer Hilbert's third question after inventing the modern computer and investigated the famous <u><strong>halting problem</strong></u>. With his proof, the undecidability of our mathematics system was cemented in history.</p>\n<h2>Mathematics is Fundementally Flawed</h2>\n<p>So what now? We're left to work in a system with the lingering possibility that it may be inconsistent and well, there's nothing we can do about it. Was all of this, for nothing? Quite the opposite actually.</p>\n<p>Turing's ideas about computability came from his concept of the Turing Machine which in turn arose from thinking about Hilbert's question. It's quite crazy to think that all modern computers stem from the weird paradoxes of self-reference, but it's true! Yes there is a hole at the bottom of mathematics. And yes this hole means that we will never know everything with certainty. And yes you may think this realization would have driven mathematicians mad and led to the disintegration of the entire field. But no. Instead, thinking about a simple comparison of size transformed the entire concept of infinity, changed the course of a World War and somehow has led directly to the invention of the device you're reading this on right now.</p>\n<p>It's easy to take a pessimistic view on mathematics after this reading, being fundementally flawed and all, but I think there's something beautiful about these holes and the journeys that result trying to patch them up. Its like chasing the rays of a rainbow, you know you'll never be able to reach them, but deep down inside, you still believe you can.</p>","categories":["Foundations of Mathematics","Math History"],"date":"May 09, 2022","description":"Mathematics is fundementally flawed.

effect</strong></u>. Thats is, the flap of a butterfly's wings in the Amazon can cause a tornado in Texas. As you may have guessed, the cliché is quite superficial. What really is the butterfly effect? What is all the rage? Is it at all useful? Why should I care?</p>\n<p>To start exploring, we first need to take a brief look at some history.</p>\n<h2>Dynamics and Chaos</h2>\n<p>For most people, studying dynamics started and ended with highschool physics. You know, Newton's Law — F=ma. The core idea here is that once you had your system and initial conditions, you could just plug them in and predict the motion history of the particle forever into the future — the system is <u><strong>deterministic</strong></u>. This sounds too good to be true, and well that's because it is. With the advent of more powerful computers, scientists very quickly realized that seamingly simple dynamical systems, for which predicting the future appeared trivial, turned out to be quite unpredictable. The motion was <u><strong>chaotic</strong></u>.</p>\n<p>The most famous example of this occured in 1963 when meteorologist and mathematician <u><strong>Edward Lorenz</strong></u> derived a dynamical system to predict the weather. In his model, he had variables that represented many things like wind speeds, temperatures, humitidies, etc. One day he ran the simulation and then wanted to re-analyze some of the data from the end. Instead of restarting the simulation from the beginning, to save time, he started it from the middle and inputted the corresponding initial conditions from the data he already had from running the simulation earlier. The system is deterministic, so no harm is done by doing this, the final results should be identical to his previous results as the input conditions we used. To his surprise, the weather machine predicted completely different values. How could this be if the system was deterministic?</p>\n<p>The culprit: a rounded decimal number on the computer printout. When Lorenz restarted the simulation midway through, the initial condition he entered would be something like 0.506 where the unknown <u><strong>true</strong></u> value would have been 0.506127. Such a small difference was considered negligible at the time, but this was Lorenz's huge discovery. In some systems, small changes in initial conditions produced large changes in long-term outcome.</p>\n<div style = \"display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center\">\n    <img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/b7tpfNx/lorenz.png\" alt=\"lorenz\" height=400rem>\n</div>\n<p>In the above image, we see the beautiful <u><strong>Lorenz attractor</strong></u>. Depicted is the trajectory history of two particles, a red one and a yellow one. The two particles start at near identical initial points, with only a 0.00001 difference. Initially the particles follow the same path on top of one another, but as time goes on, the two particle paths start to diverge and each particle plays out the rest of its history quite differently compared to its previous partner. Slowly, the paths of these particles start to create a unique surface and that is what we see here. It looks like a butterfly, hence the butterfly effect — deterministic sensitive dependence on initial conditions.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of deterministic systems, but not all of them behave this way. Why does the Lorenz system evolve in this manner? Clearly something inherent to the system caused this, but what?</p>\n<h3>Randomness vs. Chaos</h3>\n<p>In physical systems, the paragon of chaotic phenomena is <u><strong>turbulence</strong></u>. You know that type of airflow that makes your plane ride very unpleasant. A rising column of smoke, or eddies behind a boat are great examples of chaotic motion. But how does this differ from randomness, or are they similar?</p>\n<p>A <u><strong>random</strong></u> motion is characterized by truly unknown inputs. Contrasted with <u><strong>chaotic</strong></u> motion, where the inputs are exactly known. So then why is it that some deterministic systems behave all irregular? The answer lays in the structure of the system itself. In specific, whether or not the system is <u><strong>nonlinear</strong></u>.</p>\n<p>For most of us, our physics careers in highschool and university were centered around <u><strong>linear</strong></u> systems. This enviroment is idealized in order to make up problems for testing. In reality, nonlinear dynamics describe almost everything. So to return to the question of why only some deterministic systems behave irregularly... the behavior arises from the system's nonlinearities, if they exist. Not all nonlinear systems are chaotic. However a chaotic system is necessarily nonlinear.</p>\n<div style = \"display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center\">\n    <img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/QCJJBb5/lorenzEq.png\" alt=\"lorenzEq\" height=200rem>\n</div>\n<p>The Lorenz system, shown above, is clearly nonlinear. This allows for the possibility of chaotic behvaiour. The sensitivity to initial conditions confirms the occurence of chaos.</p>\n<h4>But Is It Useful?</h4>\n<p>A great deal of excitement in nonlinear dynamics today is centered around the hope that the transition from ordered to disordered flow may be explained with relatively simple equations and models. The recognition that chaotic dynamics are inherent in many nonlinear phenomena has really created a sense of revolution in science and engineering today.</p>\n<p>At best, one would think of chaos as fascinating. At worst, a nuisance to be avoided. Nothing more, nothing less. But for the past 30 years, there have been some pretty ingenious uses for <u><strong>chaos theory</strong></u>.</p>\n<p>One application has been private/secret communications. Commonly, this task is performed by using some sort of code that is only known to the sender and receiver. The communications can be encrypted and decrypted using this code. The problem with this method is that your communications are only as secure as your encryption method, and modern technology has now made it very easy to crack codes quickly.</p>\n<p>This new form of encryption relies on the discovery of <u><strong>synchronized chaos</strong></u>. The details are facinating, and I will probably write something up on the topic in the future, but for the moment I'll share a brief top-down view. The basic idea is to \"mask\" our transmitted message with much louder chaos. If there were an outside listener trying to eavesdrop on our conversation, they would only hear the meaningless chaotic noise. But then wouldn't my intended reciever hear this same noise? Yes, but no. The reciever is made of an indetical chaotic circuit so that when the message is recieved, the chaos can be perfectly reproduced, or synchronized, and the mask can be subtracted off!</p>\n<p>Voila, chaotic encryption.</p>","categories":["Chaos Theory","Math History"],"date":"May 07, 2022","description":"What really is the butterfly effect?
